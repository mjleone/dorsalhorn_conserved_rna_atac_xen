Processing and analysis code accompanying the manuscript "Conserved dorsal horn neuron subtype-specific enhancers are implicated in the genetic risk of chronic pain". 

Note that the initial processing of the macaque snRNA-seq is a separate Pfenning Lab repo https://github.com/pfenninglab/dorsal_horn_snrnaseq
Gene-based LDSC was done with code from https://github.com/chaitanyasrinivasan/bioinfotools
HALPER mapping of orthologs was done with code from https://github.com/pfenninglab/atac_data_pipeline

In the envs directory: 
The r3_archr.yml environment is provided for the mouse snATAC processing (Figures 5,6). The r4_xenium.yml environment is provided for the xenium analysis (Figure 4). The r4_rnaseq.yml environment is provided for the snRNA-seq and other analyses (Figures 1,2,3).
